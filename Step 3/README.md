# Exploratory Data Analysis

## Overview

This repository is a demonstration of exploratory data analysis on [Iris dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/scikit-learn/iris) in the [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/datasets) dataset hub.

## Installing and running the demo

Steps to **run** the jupyter notebook:

- First, we clone the repository using the command

  ```
  git clone repository-url
  ```

  . You can open it using **Visual Studio Code** or any editor of your choice. We need to have the Jupyter extension to run the notebook inside an editor.

- Alternatively, if we already have **jupyterlab** or **jupyter** installed on our system, we can start a terminal in the project directory and run the command
  ```
  jupyter lab or jupyter notebook
  ```
- In the project folder, we find a **requirements.txt** file. We need to have pip3 installed, and we can run the command

  ```
  pip3 install -r requirements.txt
  ```

  to install our packages required to run the notebook.

- Once in jupyter, we can click the Run All command to run all the cells and visualize the output of each cell.

## Reasons for choosing the dataset

- The dataset I chose is the very popular Iris dataset which includes three species of flowers along with their properties.
- I chose this dataset because although its simple and vibrant to work with it, we can perfrom different types of analysis and generate many different visualizations on this data to gain deeper insights into the different types and properties of those flowers.
